# David's Excellent Thesis Template

This is a template for writing theses or similar documents.

It started way back in 1994 and was subsequently refined to account for evolving "tastes".

It currently supports three main formats (easily adapted) in use at TÃ©cnico.
These differ only on the official cover and are provided separately to avoid repeated efforts.

* MSc thesis (document-msc.tex and chapters/0000-preliminar-msc.tex)
* CAT report (document-cat.tex and chapters/0000-preliminar-cat.tex)
* PhD thesis (document-phd.tex and chapters/0000-preliminar-phd.tex)

The format supports the usal acronym and nomenclature packages.
It also features less common author and subject indices.
