## What is this?

Each folder contains the results of one set of experiments

### Baseline

Each dataset is used independently


## File nomenclature

<trainPercentage>\_<alpha>\_<maxIterations>\_<actFunction>.txt where

1. __trainPercentage__ is the percentage of the dataset used for testing
2. __alpha__ is the L2 penalty (regularization term) parameter of the MLP
3. __maxIterations__ is the maximum number of iterations accepted until training stops
4. __actFunction__ is the activation function for the hidden and output layers of the MLP
